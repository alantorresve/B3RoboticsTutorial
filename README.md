Group B3 Introduction to Robotics Tutorial

This project includes the execution of three basic tasks to demonstrate our understanding and ability to operate an EPSON Pro-6-Axis Robot arm. The performance of each task is measured by the time required for completion.

## Task 1: Pick and Place
- Move three blocks and three tokens respectively from the Feeder to the Tray in their respective positions.
- Use the Alignment Fixture to ensure the nozzle grasps onto the center of each block or token.
- Perform the task in reverse, without using the Fixture.

## Task 2: Stack-up
- Pile up 5 blocks and 5 tokens respectively in alternating order.

## Task 3: Integration Task
- Include fixtures designed by team members, such as I/O box and HMI terminal, to operate the robot.
- Incorporate 3D printed Alignment and Feeder into the robot's workcell.
- Perform tasks...(choose tasks)
