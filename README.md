Group B3 Introduction to Robotics Tutorial

This project includes the execution of three basic tasks to demonstrate our understanding and ability to operate an EPSON Pro-6-Axis Robot arm. The performance of each task is measured by the time required for completion.

## Task 1: Pick and Place
- Move three blocks and three tokens respectively from the Feeder to the Tray in their respective positions.
- Use the Alignment Fixture to ensure the nozzle grasps onto the center of each block or token.


## Task 2: Stack-up
- Pile up 6 blocks and 6 tokens respectively in alternating order.

## Task 3: Integration Task

ðŸ”´ STOP : Stop/Resume current operation
ðŸŸ  RESET : Resets the Robot and checks the trays and feeders again 
ðŸŸ¢ START: Starts the operation by checking the trays and feeders for information
ðŸ”µ REPOSITION: Reposition all the tray pieces detected to the feeders, if some
âšª RANDOM: Execute a Random Stacking and checks if the piece is a token or a block and the orientation of the block
