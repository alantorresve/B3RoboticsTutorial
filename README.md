Group B3 Introduction to Robotics Tutorial

This project includes the execution of three basic tasks to demostrate our understanding and abbility to operate an EPSON Pro-6-Axis Robot arm. The performance of each task is measured by the time required for completion.

Task 1: Pick and Place
- Move three blocks and three tokens respectively from the Feeder to the Tray in their respective position
- Use the Alignment Fixture to make sure the nozzle graps onto the center of each block or token
- Perform the task in reverse, obviate the Fixture

Task 2: Stack-up
- Pile up 5 blocks and 5 tokens respectively in alternating order

Task 3: Integration Task
- Include fixtures designed by team members, such as I/0 box and HMI terminal to operate the robot
- 3D printed Alignment and Feeder are incorporated into the workcell of the robot
- Perform tasks...(choose tasks)
